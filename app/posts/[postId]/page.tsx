         <p className="text-lg text-black">As ve grown, ve seen how Preline has helped companies such as Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and Intercom bring their designers closer together to create amazing things. ve also learned that when the culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the better teams adapt and communicate with one another.</p>
         <p className="text-lg text-black">s why are excited to share that now have a <a className="text-blue-600 decoration-2 hover:underline font-medium" href="#">free version of Preline</a>, which will allow individual designers, startups and other small teams a chance to create a culture of openness early on.</p>

           <p className="text-lg text-black">know the po of sharing is real, and want to create an opportunity for everyone to try Preline and explore how transformative open communication can be. Now you can have a team of one or two designers and unlimited spectators (think PMs, management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the design process earlier.</p>

         </ul>
         <p className="text-lg text-black">Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can watch the design process unfold, both for themselves and for the people they work with â€“ no matter if its a fellow designer, product manager, developer or client. Preline allows you to invite more people into the process, creating a central place for conversation around design. As those teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in how they communicate and work together.</p>
